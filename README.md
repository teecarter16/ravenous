# Ravenous
![Ravenous Demo](./videos/Ravenous-demo.mp4)
Ravenous is a Yelp-like project built over 5-days, that tested my knowledge of JavaScript and React.
I started off by using create-react-app then created all of the Static Components and simulated what Ravenous should look like after returning search results, by hard coding business information and rendering it manually.
